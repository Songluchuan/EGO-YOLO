# EGO-YOLO
We retraine the YOLO-series detection framework on the ego-object dataset in order to obtain a more complete egocentric perspective visual tool chain. The backbone for the detecor is from YOLOv5. The ego-object dataset is from the : https://ai.meta.com/datasets/egoobjects-downloads/. In this work, we do not set the object classification branch in YOLO, only the foreground (object) and background were classified.
