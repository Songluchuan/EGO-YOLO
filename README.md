# EGO-YOLO
We retraine the YOLO-series detection framework on the ego-object dataset in order to obtain a more complete egocentric perspective visual tool chain. The backbone for the detecor is from YOLOv5. The ego-object dataset is from the : https://ai.meta.com/datasets/egoobjects-downloads/. In this work, we do not set the object classification branch in YOLO, only the foreground (object) and background were classified. 
1. We freeze the Classify Decoder and set the classification-head into a binary class structure â€“ front ground and  back ground. 
2. We involve the COCO pretrained backbone and finetune on the Ego-Object Datasets
3. Reset all the data into a COCO format from detron2 format.
Here is the mAP-50 results without pretrained YOLOv5 and pretrained YOLOv5:
